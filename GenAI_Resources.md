# Generative AI Resources

From my Manning book: [The Complete Obsolete Guide to Generative Artificial Intelligence](http://mng.bz/j1Ax)

By now I'm sure you've noticed how fast things change in the AI world. Announcements from the big players of new features for their flagship products come nearly daily. But there's are also frequent news about new third-party applications making innovative use of existing platforms and new and creative ways of working with the tools we already have. 

I used to try to keep on top of it all. But that didn't work out well. 

Nevertheless, it's important to stay at least broadly familiar with as much of what's out there as possible. With that in mind, this page contains links to a few examples of tools covering all the main categories of AI and AI-adjacent tools that I plan to update regularly. 

To be honest, my definition of "regularly" might not always match your expectations, so feel free to open a git issue or [drop me a note](mailto:office@bootstrap-it.com) with any categories or up-and-coming tool that I might have missed (or wilfully ignored). Just bear in mind that this list is not meant to include _every single_ AI tool out there. Rather, it's a place where we can all check back from time to time to make sure we're not missing any important new functionality.
